# Negative dataset impact on training binding classifiers

We build datasets in which the negative dataset has varied features in order to optimally design negative datasets for training antigen binder vs non-binder classifiers.

Various schematics can be found at in a [diagrams file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sr1f8ryaj_rKazp8bE1wPwX3m7x11kie/view?usp=sharing).

## Data

I received data by slack, which I call `slack_1` for now.

## Notebooks

- 01_Explore: explores `slack_1` data structure.
- 02_Datasetgenerator: developing dataset generators.
